# Project Title

## Overview

This project is a chatbot designed to collect AI ideas from users. The collected ideas will be stored and managed using a backend system built with Cloudflare D1.

## Database Setup (Cloudflare D1)

A Cloudflare D1 database will be utilized to store the AI ideas collected by the chatbot.

- **Purpose**: To store and manage AI ideas submitted by users via the chatbot.
- **Location**: The setup and management of the D1 database will primarily reside in the `wrangler backend repo`.
- **Status**: This database still needs to be built.

## Admin Panel

An admin panel will be developed to provide an interface for viewing, sorting, and managing the AI ideas stored in the Cloudflare D1 database.

- **Functionality**: View, sort, and manage AI ideas. (Further functionalities can be detailed here as they are defined).
- **Status**: To be built.

## To-Do

The following components and features still need to be built:

- **Backend System**: Develop the backend infrastructure for receiving, processing, and storing AI ideas from the chatbot.
- **Cloudflare D1 Database Implementation**: Set up and integrate the D1 database as described in the "Database Setup (Cloudflare D1)" section.
- **Admin Panel Development**: Build the admin panel as described in the "Admin Panel" section for managing the collected AI ideas.
